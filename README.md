# Gold-Price-Prediction-
DL Project predicting the Gold Price based on the dataset which contain data from 2008 to 2018.
Document Localization:

- there is many tools and methods used in this project to get the highest possible accuracy and These are the steps that have been taken

First, exploring the dataset and remove null values, then we apply the Correlation which contain (Positive Correlation and Negative Correlation) and that help us to find the relation between every item or currency in the dataset.

Second, moving the Gold column from ( X to Y ) to compare between the Gold Price and the others items and columns then we splitting the data into Training data and Test Data and after that we Training  the Model  by using (Random Forest Regressor)

Third, prediction on the Test Data and after that we apply the R squared error to know it's accuracy and the effects of that in the final accuracy score.

Fourth, Comparing between the Actual Values and Predicted Values in a Plot
